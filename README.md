# Rhovas

Rhovas is a programming language intended for API design and enforcement. Using
Rhovas, developers can better express the contracts and intention of their code
to help create correct, maintainable software.

This repository is intended to define an informal, semantic specification for
Rhovas and also explain the motivation behind design decisions, including
alternative approaches and tradeoffs. Put simply, *what* and ***why***.
