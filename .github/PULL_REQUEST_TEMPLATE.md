# NOTICE: PRs are currently NOT accepted

At this time, we are not accepting PRs to this repository until the core
language has been established and is ready for more detailed review. There is a
lot of work on Rhovas which is undocumented, and our focus needs to be on
creating that initial documentation so we can support community contributions.

Until then, the best way to contribute to the language design of Rhovas right
now is to ask questions and provided feedback on the language in our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gm96xd8).
